  In this tutorial i will show you how to make simple a LED Chaser or Sequencer using 555 & 4017 circuit. 
  
  You can watch the video which is embedded in this step for construction, 
  
  parts list, circuit diagram & testing or you can continue reading the post for further details.
  
  A simple LED chaser hobby circuit can be made using 555 timer and CD4017 counter IC. 
  
  You can use this circuit for decorative purposes. By modifying the circuit in a proper way, 
  
  you can even use this to control lights working on AC mains.
